Text-Substitute - Substitute variables in strings

Text::Substitute provides a single function, subst, that takes a
string and substitutes variables by target texts.

Example:

    use Text::Substitute;

    my $ctl = { vars => { fn => "Johann", ln => "Bach" } };
    say subst( $ctl, "The famous %{fn} %{ln}." );
    # Result = "The famous Johann Bach"

Other features are selecting true/false texts:

    "The task is %{done|ready|unfinished}."

Testing specific values:

    "%{instrument=piano|Play this with elbows}"

Selecting one out of a list of values:

    "First customer is %{customer.1}"
